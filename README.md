## Overview

This repository contains the control systems and sensor integration codes for a Mars rover prototype developed for the **International Rover Challenge (IRC)**. As part of the team, the rover was designed to execute complex tasks with precision, reliability, and compliance with IRC guidelines. These scripts form the backbone of the rover's autonomous and manual control systems, enabling dynamic performance across multiple missions.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Rover Control**: Precise control of the rover's movement and actuators using ROS and Python.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Implements inverse kinematics for robotic arm positioning and actuator manipulation.
- **Joystick Integration**: Real-time manual control for navigating the rover and operating mechanical components via joystick inputs.
- **Sensor Data Logging**: Collects and logs critical environmental data such as methane levels, soil moisture, and temperature.
- **ROS-Driven Architecture**: Modular ROS nodes and topics for efficient communication and operation.
- **Dynamic Actuator Control**: Supports configurable speed and motion for actuators, ensuring smooth and accurate performance.
- **Base Mobility**: Responsive control of the rover's base for effective maneuverability during missions.
- **Emergency Protocols**: Equipped with a kill switch mechanism to instantly halt all operations in emergencies.

## Purpose

These codes collectively enable the rover to participate in IRC missions, which include exploratory tasks, sample collection, and precision-driven dynamic operations. The modular and scalable design allows the rover to adapt seamlessly to diverse mission requirements while maintaining efficiency and safety.

Here are some videos of our rover running on this very same codebase!
